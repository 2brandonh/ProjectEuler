# ProjectEuler

This repository contains some of the projects I worked on for Project Euler challenges when I started learning basic algorithms written in C++. The problem details can be found on https://projecteuler.net/archives

Interesting ones include:
#7 which utilizes the Sieve of Eratosthenes
,#14 utilizing dynamic programming for finding collatz chains.
